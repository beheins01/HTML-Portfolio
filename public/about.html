<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, I am Benjamin Heins and I am a software engineer. I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University with Kum Laude honors.
  Iam a huge Star Wars nerd and have recently been getting into Anime. In my spare time I love to play competative card games, go out with friends,
  code and play video games. I have done a senior project with Arthrex working on a web application that searches through their proprietary API
  to help find articles about certain things in the medical industry.
