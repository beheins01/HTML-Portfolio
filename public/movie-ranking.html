<h1>The Best Movies That Ben Has Seen!</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Star Wars Movie and this is due ot he the fact that it connects
    the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy. This movie also has some of the most
    captivating fights and moments in all of the Star Wars franchise. A must see for 
    any major movie lover.

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This movie is really cool and trippy. This movie makes you question the world you know
    while also making you realize the world that is in your head. This was a movie I first
    watched in high school but fell in love with it after watching it a few times because
    the first time makes no sense and then it slowly makes more and more sense as you watch more.

<h3>Now You See Me</h3>
<p>This movie is a great magic based movie. This is about doing the right thing for people
    and getting there stuff back that was stolen by stealing through magic tricks and illusions.
